          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>In class we were posed a question: How can we solve a daily problem people face?  Since this was during the early days of COVID, before Shelter in Place, we aimed to reduce anxierty related to COVID. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We learned that people are less anxious when they feel they're taking steps to avoid getting sick. We identified a hand washing tracker as a way to make users feel in control of their health. We designed a watch app that seemlessly integrates this tracking into users’ existing routines.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h3>Role</h3>
          <p>
            I was a UX Designer on a team of 3 design students. I focued on user research and synthesis, feature prioritization, user flow and journey mapping, and mocks and prototypes for the Apple Watch, and usability testing.

          <h3>Research Objectives</h3>
          <p>
            We began our sprint with user research to better understand how viral outbreaks impact mental health on young urban professionals 
            <br>
            <br>
            We needed answers to two questions:
            <br>
            <ol>
              <li>What makes people anxious about the contagious illnesses?</li>
              <li>What do people need to feel less anxious about contagious illnesses?</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

        <div class="col">
          <h3>User Insights</h3>
          <p>
            We conducted 6 qualitative user interviews, on young urban professionals in the San Francisco Bay Area. We found three key insights
            <br>
            <ol>
              <li>People are anxious when they don’t have control over their health</li>
              <li>Taking protective actions make people feel in control</li>
              <li>The novelty of COVID-19 makes it difficult to know what actions to take</li>
            </ol>

          <h3>Ideation</h3>
          <p>
            From brainstorming we came up with three high level ideas:
            <br>
            <ol>
              <li>Live doctor chat to diagnose symptoms</li>
              <li>Personalized updates on COVID</li>
              <li>A checklist of preventative actions</li>
            </ol>
            By comparing what would be delightful to the user, with what’s feasible to build and good for society at scale we zeroed in on checklists of preventable actions users can take to protect themselves
          </p>
          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            This kicked off a second round of ideation, for how to best design a hand washing checklist
            <br>
            <br>
            We did a competitive analysis for inspiration, and the Apple Watch's Activity app led us to a solution that uses wearable sensors to passively track the user's hand washing behavior.

      <h3>Journey Map</h3>
      <p>
        We sketched out the likely way a day would play out using our watch app.
      </p>
      <img src="images/journey.png" class="img-fluid">
      <h3>User Flow</h3>
      <p>
        We aimed for a subtle way to users to know that they’ve washed their hands a full 30 seconds. Users can rely on vibration instead of having to touch or even look at the screen.
      </p>
      <img src="images/flow.png" class="img-fluid">
      <h3>Data Visualization Iteration</h3>
      <p>
        A critical part of the design, was creating a status meter that users could glance at on their watchface to learn whether they need to wash their hands. We iterated on a meter that fills when they app detects hand washing, and drains over time as the user’s protection from germs and viruses wears off

          <h3>Improved Onboarding</h3>
          <p>
            Users had trouble comprehending core concepts, such as that the app automatically tracked hand washing, and that the height of the meter represented how protected their hands were.
            <br>
            <br>
            We iterated on the onboarding flow to make these concepts clearer

          <h3>Replace “streak” 
            with visualization</h3>
          <p>
            Originally, the app tracked how long the user could go without too long of a gap between hand washes. This “streak” concept was too difficult to comprehend.
            <br>
            <br>
            Instead of explicitly tracking this stat, daily summary stats were shown to help users judge for themselves whether they washed frequently enough

          <h3>Learnings</h3>
          <h5>Challenge assumptions</h5>
          <p>
            The most straightforward solution to our problem statement would have been a mobile app that would inform people about COVID. By not limiting ourselves to that during brainstorming we instead came up with a more novel solution that uses wearable technology to inform you when to wash your hands. 
          </p>
          <h5>There can be too much transparency</h5>
          <p>
            At first we tried to explain exactly how long it would take for the hand wash meter to fully empty. This was too much information and confused users. With simpler stats users were able to more easily intuit a conceptual model for how it worked.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h3>Opportunities</h3>
          <h5>Environmental testing</h5>
          <p>Our short timeline, and shelter-in-place made it difficult to test how our design really fits into user's daily routine. An opportunity would be to prototype vibration during hand washing, or use journalling to see if a protoype does result in more frequent hand washingusability testing. </p>
          <h5>Snooze</h5>
          <p>
            We anticipate the above testing would show that sometimes hand washing reminders came at a bad time, and users would forget to wash their hands.
Ability to snooze reminders would make them more effective
